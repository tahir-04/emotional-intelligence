# 🧠 Emotional Intelligence Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **Emotional Intelligence (EI)** using machine learning techniques. Emotional Intelligence plays a crucial role in human behavior, decision-making, communication, and professional success. The notebook explores how emotional patterns can be identified, processed, and evaluated using data-driven approaches.

The project is implemented entirely in **Python** using a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to understand, experiment with, and extend.
